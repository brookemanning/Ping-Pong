## PingPong - Brooke, Yuki, and Mia

Welcome to our game of Ping Pong! Thank you for playing. 

Here are some general notes on the game. 

Our game of Ping Pong is a two-player game. One player will control the up and down motion of their paddle with the W and S keys, respectively, and the other will use the up and down arrows. 

Once the game hits 5 points for one player, that player wins. 

You will have the option to play again, as well as the choice to select a level (easy, medium, or hard) each time you play the came. 

## Citations: 

We used code from https://github.com/Seth-Joseph/Project/blob/main/pingPong.m to guide our work. for the visuals, Yuki used the command figure and a rectangle as a reference before adding new code. For ball velocity, Brooke used the code as a structure to update ball position and velocity. For the key press/paddle movement, Mia used the callback function as a general structure before changing the code by using 'min,' 'max,' functions in order to update the position of the paddles, and introducing global variables. In addition, we added levels and a replay function to Seth's work.

## Demos: 

Below, we are linking a few demos to show you our game! 

Unfortunately, the final version of our code, condensedpingpongsetup.m, which includes a condensed setup as well as randomized velocity, has a few bugs that appeared late in the coding process. 
An earlier version, levels_v3, is fully functional. 

We are linking demos below for each - firstly, condensedpingpongsetup, and then, levels_v3.
